It is common for service desk teams to have multiple internal  groups that handle tickets pertaining to a certain category (or issue). The admin assigns tickets that fall under a certain category to corresponding teams. This makes ticket resolution more efficient by bringing some order to the chaos! 

## Create groups

Go to Inbox -> Chats -> Settings -> Groups -> Add Group
