## What are Tags?

Tags are markers that can be used to categorise entities like tickets, and chats. Once marked, tickets can be grouped together, and analysed logically on the basis of their tags. 

Ex: Tickets can be mapped with tags like Open, In Progress, Closed. The user can choose to visualise all the open tickets by selecting the “Open” option under Tags in the Ticket Filters. 

## How do you use Tags for Chats and Tickets?

### Note:

1. Now while chatting with the user, the agent can just type the tag and the message added will be sent. This comes in handy when there are recurring issues or scenarios that require a standard template of communication.
