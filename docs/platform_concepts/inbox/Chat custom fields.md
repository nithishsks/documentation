# Chat Custom fields


### What are custom fields?

Custom fields can be added to tickets and are used to track business-specific information related to the customer like Order ID, Address, case details, etc. Custom fields enable your terams to add more information about a case and add further context, which helps with better reporting and to resolve issues faster. Custom fields are available for both chat as well as ticketing modules.

#### Adding a new custom field

You can define a new custom field by going to,
>Inbox > Chats > Settings > Chats configuration > Custom Fields > Add custom fields

Only **inbox admin** can create new custom fields.

#### Updating a custom field
Any agent who has access to edit a ticket can update custom fields for that ticket by simply adding the information. Admins can, therefore, update custom fields for all the tickets. Agents can also search by custom field values as seen below (searching by custom field country)

### Chat disposition with custom fields
You can also mark a custom field as mandatory to create/transfer or close a ticket while creating the custom field. In such cases, the agent can not dispose off the chat without providing a value for the custom field as seen in the example below :

### Automation on custom fields
Whenever a custom field is updated, we send an event **ticket-update** with changeType **change_custom_field**, you can capture this event in builder using event hub to develop automation flows following custom field updates - *e.g. updating an order in shopify when the order ID custom field is updated in Yellow AI.*
